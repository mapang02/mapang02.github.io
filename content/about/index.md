Welcome to my website! 

I am a student at Stony Brook University and I major in Computer Science and I'm interested in a variety of areas, including web development, algorithms, and data science.

In my spare time, I like to read, listen to music, and go on long walks. I'm also interested in learning art and game development, and I'm hoping to create my own game someday.
